EarthArXiv is planning to refresh and expand the Advisory Board 
and Community Ambassadors. More details below, but first an 
introduction to preprints, preprint servers, and EarthArXiv...
</p>

<p>
A ‘preprint’ is an as-yet, non-peer-reviewed version of a scholarly 
paper that precedes publication in a peer-reviewed journal; a 
‘preprint server’, such as the community-led, volunteer-run 
<a href="http://www.eartharxiv.org ">‘EarthArXiv’</a>, is an online platform 
purpose-built to host preprints. A preprint may represent the same 
manuscript eventually submitted to a peer-reviewed journal, although 
other content, which may currently be difficult to publish (e.g.
datasets, method papers), can also be uploaded and, if appropriate, 
explicitly linked to the associated manuscript hosted on the 
publisher’s website. In this way, preprints provide storage and access 
to important scholarly content that would otherwise be lost.
More details can be found in <a href="https://eartharxiv.github.io/moderation.html">EarthArXiv’s moderation policy</a>, 
which outlines what type of material we do and do not accept.</p>

<p>
Despite being new to many if not most Earth Scientists, preprints have 
been in use for >20 years. For example, the original, Cornell-ran 
preprint server, ArXiv, which covers, amongst other things, Physics, 
Mathematics, and Computer Science, hosts >1.3 million preprints.
Furthermore, several new preprint servers (e.g. BioRxiv, PsyArXiv,
Paleorxiv) have recently been launched in many branches of the 
physical and social sciences, with many more in the pipeline. Major 
funders (e.g. German Science Foundation (DFG), Wellcome Trust, Medical 
Research Council, Cancer Research) now encourage preprint submission 
in support of grant applications; preprints may thus inform grant 
review process and academic advancement at all levels of experience.
In fact, some major US-based academic institutions actively encourage 
job applicants to include preprints in support of their applications.
Major publishers, such as SpringerNature, Elsevier, and Wiley, also 
actively encourage the use of preprints to help enhance the quality of 
research they receive and may ultimately publish, and AGU host their 
own Wiley-supported preprint server, ESSOAr. We should also add that 
EarthArXiv, like several other preprint servers, also hosts and can 
thus act as a repository for ‘postprints’ (i.e. published articles), 
helping facilitate (Green) OA and meeting the needs of the many 
researchers who lack an institutional and/or national scholarly 
publications repository. The broader benefits of prepritning, for
early- and late-career researchers alike, are clearly outlined in 
several online resources, such as these provided by <a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint">PLOSOne</a> 
and <a href="https://asapbio.org/preprint-info/preprint-faq">ASAPBio</a>.
</p>

<p>
During its first two years, EarthArXiv (a community-led preprint 
service for the Earth and Planetary Sciences, which is built on 
infrastructure provided by the non-profit <a href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science’s</a>
‘Open Science Framework’ has been led by a group of international volunteers, organised by the <a href="http://www.esipfed.org/">
Earth Science Information Partners</a>. Since launching in 
October 2017, EarthArXiv has received >1000 submissions, with material 
spanning a range of Earth Science disciplines, much of which is 
relevant to the BSRG community (e.g. sedimentology, geochemistry, 
stratigraphic analysis, etc). There have been almost 5000 visitors to 
the site; we strongly encourage you to visit and personally assess the 
quality of material available for consumption. We have been featured 
in <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/giant-pandas-gender-lawsuit-and-more-disaster-havoc-1.22664
">Nature</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/dueling-preprint-servers-coming-geosciences">Science</a>
and on several science <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqYccGyVh4g">podcasts</a>
We have visited SpringerNature and PLOSone to discuss future developments in the area 
of preprints, more specifically how preprints can become an integral 
part of the scientific and, in particular, peer-review process in 
Earth and Planetary Science. We have hosted ‘Townhall’-style meetings, 
alongside AGU, at the EGU General Assembly in Vienna.</p>

<p>
As per our constitution, we are looking to refresh the EarthArXiv 
Advisory Council, who are primarily responsible for: (i) moderating 
content submitted to EarthArXiv; (ii) coordinate future efforts to 
obtain funding and/or endorsements for EarthArXiv from professional 
societies; and (iv) work with OSF to develop future functionality for 
EarthArXiv. There are currently 15 Advisory Council members; for 
continuity, we plan to retain the services of 8 current members, and 
to add 8 new members (to serve a 2-year term), increasing the Advisory 
Council to 16. To select the Advisory Council, we will follow the 
approach used in 2017; i.e. after ensuring for the desired level of 
diversity (e.g. race, geographic, ethnic, gender, geography, 
area-of-interest, or any self-declared protected characteristic), a 
random sample of 8 members will be chosen. If you are interested in 
serving, please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_MJPA9EWEZsdsmcyMH_kAOWxX-UAAslxSDxaYuv5qsc/viewform?edit_requested=true">this form</a>
</p>

<p>Nominations will be received until October 18th at 2359.</p>

<p>
Please note that we are also looking for any number of Community 
Ambassadors who are willing to promote EarthArXiv to their respective 
communities. You can help the community by: (i) promoting EarthArXiv 
in your home institutions, communities, and countries via social 
media, presentations, etc; and (ii) work with Earth science publishers 
and funders to accept preprints as a valid step in the publishing 
pipeline.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact either 
Chris Jackson (c.jackson@imperial.ac.uk) or Tom Narock 
(thomas.narock@goucher.edu), two of the co-founders of EarthArXiv.
</p>

<p>On behalf of the EarthArXiv, ESIP, and OSF team,</p>

<p>Chris Jackson</p>
