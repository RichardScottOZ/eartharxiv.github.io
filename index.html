			<h4>EarthArXiv Diversity Statement</h4>

			<p>Capturing a broad spectrum of interest and experience will help EarthArXiv consider and include the full geoscience community. An essential step to achieving this objective is to ensure broad and intersectional diversity in staffing our Advisory Council.</p>

			<p>Geoscience research is done by people of a diverse range of gender identities, sexual orientations, racial and cultural backgrounds, abilties, religions, ages, career stages and fields, and socioeconomic and immigration statuses. These intersectional identities impacts how research is conducted, data analyzed, and results shared. We recognize that a diverse and inclusive scientific community asks a broader range of questions yet also faces different barriers to participating in geoscience. By listening to diverse voices, we will be rewarded by a greater understanding of our world.</p>

			<p>In an effort to represent and include the broadest possible spectrum of geoscientists, EarthArXiv is committed to the following obejctives in forming its Advisory Council:
				<ul>
					<li>FIELD: We will include representatives from a broad spectrum of geoscience fields such as, but not limited to, atmospheric science, hydrology, environmental science, geochemistry, geology, geophysics, geological engineering, oceanography, planetary science, and paleontology.</li>
					<li>GENDER IDENTITY: We will strive for gender parity in our Advisory Council, with awareness of the need for flexibility to include transgender and gender-fluid people.</li>
					<li>ETHNIC AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND: We will strive to include a broad range of ethinic and cultural backgrounds in our Advisory Council, with particular focus on traditionally excluded populations including asian, black, indigenous, pacific islander, and latinix scientists.</li>
					<li>GEOGRAPHY: We will respect the global nature of the geoscience community by aiming for an equal split of representivives from or working in Europe, North America, Asia, and the rest of the world.
					</li>
					<li>CAREER: We will aim to have at least one representative each from industry, goverment, and media, as well as at least one representative from key stages witin academia including students; early-, mid-, and late-career professors; researchers at teaching-centric and research-centric universities; and independent scholars.</li>
					<li>ABILITY: We will aim to include representatives with a broad range of physical and mental abilities.</li>
					<li>SEXUAL ORIENTATION: We will aim to include representives with a broad range of sexual 
					orientations.</li> 
				</ul>

			It is our hope that meeting all these objectives within a 15 to 16-person Advisory Council will subsequently include a range of intersectional identities to further enhance our understanding. We recognize that we may not always achieve all of these objectives, and will be as transparent as possible about our effectiveness witin the confines of respecting the privacy of our Advisory Council members.</p>

			<p>We also recognize we may not yet be considering all aspects of how identity shapes the science that we do. We further commit to continuing to learn and adapt how we define and include diverse populations in response to the needs of our greater community.</p>

			<p>As EarthArXiv came to fruition roughly 125 individuals volunteered to help out. We are grateful for such overwhelming support. Our initial Advisory Council was selected from this set of 125 volunteers with the above objectives in mind and these individuals will serve a 2-year term. The current Advisory Council is always prominently displayed on our <a href="http://eartharxiv.org">preprint submission site</a>.</p>
